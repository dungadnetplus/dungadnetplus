# What is Laravel?

Laravel is a free and open-source PHP framework that provides a set of tools and resources to build modern PHP applications. With a complete ecosystem leveraging its built-in features, and a variety of compatible packages and extensions, Laravel has seen its popularity grow rapidly in the past few years, with many developers adopting it as their framework of choice for a streamlined development process.

Laravel provides powerful database tools including an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) called  [Eloquent](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-database-models-in-laravel-with-eloquent), and built-in mechanisms for creating  [database migrations and seeders](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-database-migrations-and-seeders-to-abstract-database-setup-in-laravel). With the command-line tool Artisan, developers can bootstrap new models, controllers, and other application components, which speeds up the overall application development.

For a project-based introduction to Laravel, you can refer to our series on  [How to Build a Links Landing Page in PHP with Laravel and Docker Compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-build-a-links-landing-page-in-php-with-laravel-and-docker-compose), which goes over how to bootstrap a new Laravel application in a containerized development environment, how to interact with the database, and how to customize the page template view to show a list of curated links.
